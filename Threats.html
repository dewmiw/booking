    <p class="intropara">6 out of the 7 sea turtle species in the world are classified as threatened or endangered. From getting caught in fishing gear to losing their homes
        to being eaten by humans as meat, these creatures face many threats.If we look into detail of a few....
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="threats"><i><b>Plastic and other marine debris</b></i></h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="intropara">Marine pollution such a splastic polllution, discarded fishing gear, petroleum  by-products etc. can injure sea turtles through ingestion and entanglement. 
        The ocean being polluted can also weaken the turtle's immune systems, disrupt nesting behaviour and hatchling orientation.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3 >What can we do?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</li>
        <li>Carry out cleanups once in a while</li>
        <li>Consider a product's entire life</li>

    <h1 class="threats"><i><b>Getting caught in fishing gear</b></i></h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="intropara">The fishing industry contributes to a death of thousands of turtles each year. They are caught to obatin their meat, shell, or sometimes even unintentionally
      On the other hand, the seafood we as humans choose to eat could also effect the existence of sea turtles as it could be a disruption to their food supply and habitat.   
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>What can we do?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose your seafood carefully</li>
        <li>Spread the word</li>
        <li>Vote for the ocean</li>

    <h1 class="threats"><i><b>Climate change</b></i></h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="intropara">Climate change is a major issue in the environment at present. It effects the existence of turtles too. 
        Habitatas of the turtles such as nesting beaches and coral reefs have already been affected by rising sea levels and temperatures, but we can help avoid further damage
        by following some simple steps to help mitigate this issue.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>What can we do?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce yourt carbon footprint</li>

        Situated a few kilometres north of the main Hikkaduwa town lies the Sea Turtle
                        Hatchery and Rescue Centre, a centre with the aim of conserving
                        some of the endangered species of turtles in the world. It is just one of many turtle hatcheries
                        in the southern coast of the island. Initially
                        starting as a community project to help protect the biodiversity of the southern coast, it is
                        now a fully-fledged hatchery and rescue centre with
                        dedicated teams that work round the clock to study, care and protect several turtle species.
